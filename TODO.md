# TODO List

* Cycle detection for references - runtime or compile time
  * Runtime check - add enter/leave context calls
  * Compile time checks
    * Annotate function with set of direct references. Compute indirect reference chains after compilation. Might want to add line number parameter to function.
    * Replace function with a class. Have method for refernce graph and method for eval graph.
* x README.md
* x Dev container and CodeSpaces
* Grammar for DSL
* Parser for DSL
